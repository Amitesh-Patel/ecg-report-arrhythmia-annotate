Overview

The ECG Report Annotation Application is designed to assist doctors in annotating ECG reports by identifying and marking different types of arrhythmia present in an ECG report. The annotations are stored in a database, which can be used for model evaluation and further training.

Features

1. Doctor Identification

Doctors can enter their name to associate annotations with their identity.

2. ECG Report Viewing

The application supports ECG report visualization in PDF format for easy analysis.

3. Arrhythmia Annotation

Doctors can select multiple arrhythmia types from a dropdown menu.

If a specific arrhythmia is not in the list, doctors can manually add it, and it will be stored for future use.

4. Additional Notes

Doctors can add insights or specific observations regarding an arrhythmia.

5. Annotation Storage

Annotations are saved in a structured format, contributing to a growing dataset useful for model evaluation and training.

6. Annotation Statistics

Displays the total number of ECG reports annotated.

Shows the most recently annotated file.

7. Jump to File

Allows doctors to quickly access and review any previously annotated files.

Technical Details
